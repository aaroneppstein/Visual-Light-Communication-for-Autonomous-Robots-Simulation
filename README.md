# Visual-Light-Communication-for-Autonomous-Robots-Simulation
Final Project for MAE 252, Information Processing for Autonomous Robotics

Visual Light Communication have started to become more incorporated in hospitals as a way to aid autonomous robots to avoid hazardous areas. For this final project, we simulated a Panasonic HOSPI robot in hospital emergency conditions in Webots Simulation. The goal was to determine the lowest the robot could detect light in certain power scenarios that could happen in a hospital
